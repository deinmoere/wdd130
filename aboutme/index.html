    <h2>Deinmoere Hazel Ami Alafegha-Quakumey</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Deinmoere Hazel Ami Alafegha-Quakumey. Yes, I have a lot of names and you can choose whichever one you're comfortable pronouncing. 
        I have roots both in Ghana and Nigeria, so I can't exactly say I'm from one country. My mom is Nigerian and my dad is Ghanaian. I am single and currently live in Accra-Ghana with my younger sister and grandma. </p>
    <p>I'm 23 years old, born on the 3rd of July, 1999. I've been a member of the church since I was 5 years old or even younger, I don't quite remember.
        I recently graduated from my on-campus university here in Accra-Ghana but like people say, 'You never stop learning'. I studied Computer Science and absolutely love the technological advances being made.
        Here in BYU-I, I am majoring in Applied Technology. I hope to use the skills I already have and the skills I hope to get from this class to better my life and the lives of my family and loved ones.
    </p>
    <p> Ps. I'm the one in the middle, my sister, Teidor is on my left and our friend Patricia is on my right.</p>
