      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Have you ever visited the websites of hotels or hostels near tourist attraction cites? 
        How easy was it to navigate through the site? Well, as a web developer, creating online presence for businesses that house or accommodate travellers is what I do. 
        Picture this, a website that displays the services the hostel has to offer alongside a display of the various room categories available. <strong>Amazing</strong> right? 
        Wouldn't it be more amazing if the site allowed you to book for a room space right from the comfort of your home? 
        My proposed website will do all these and more, giving you a <em>hassle-free</em> experience as you tour the attraction sites of Accra, Ghana.</p>  <!-- change this -->
